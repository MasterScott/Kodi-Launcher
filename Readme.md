### Kodi Launcher

Small - but nevertheless useful - launcher to help *Kodi* (formerly *XBMC*) run as standalone on external drives. It automatically detects the drive letter and changes it accordingly in Kodi's configuration files, so that a previous created library will be accessed from the correct path when the drive will be using a different letter.

**Requirements:**

1. Kodi from [https://kodi.tv](https://kodi.tv)

------

**Instructions:**

1. Install a clean copy of *Kodi* on the external drive containing movies, tv-shows, music, etc
2. Run *Kodi Launcher* and create or browse the library
